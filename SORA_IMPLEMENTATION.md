# Sora 2 Video Generation Implementation

## Overview
Successfully integrated OpenAI's Sora 2 video generation API into the Superfun Draw application. Users can now select "sora-2" from the model dropdown to generate videos instead of images.

## Changes Made

### 1. HTML Updates (`index.html`)
- Added `<option>sora-2</option>` to the image model dropdown (line 286)

### 2. JavaScript Updates (`app.js`)

#### Model Detection & Parameter Adjustment (lines 648-705)
- Added model selector reading to detect when `sora-2` is selected
- Implemented conditional logic for video vs image parameters:
  - **Video aspect ratios**: Portrait (720x1280), Landscape (1280x720), Square (720x720)
  - **Video quality models**: `sora-2` (fast) or `sora-2-pro` (high quality)
  - **Image aspect ratios**: Portrait (1024x1536), Landscape (1536x1024), Square (1024x1024)
  - **Image quality**: low, medium, high, auto

#### Video Generation Workflow (lines 757-877)
Implemented async video generation with polling:

1. **Create video job**: POST to `/v1/videos` with FormData
   - Fields: prompt, model, size, seconds (default: 5)
   - Uses multipart/form-data encoding

2. **Poll for completion**: GET `/v1/videos/{video_id}` every 5 seconds
   - Checks status: queued → in_progress → completed/failed
   - Updates UI with progress percentage
   - Max polling time: 10 minutes (120 polls)

3. **Download video**: GET `/v1/videos/{video_id}/content`
   - Receives MP4 blob
   - Creates blob URL for playback

4. **Display video**: Creates `<video>` element with:
   - Controls enabled
   - Autoplay and loop
   - Proper styling (w-full, h-full, object-contain)

#### Media Cleanup (lines 731-739)
- Updated canvas cleanup to remove both images AND videos
- Applies to both template cleaning and draw button execution

#### Copy/Download Handlers (lines 1165-1257)
- **Copy button**: Detects video vs image, copies appropriate blob to clipboard
- **Download button**: Downloads as `.mp4` (video) or `.png` (image) with prompt-based filename

#### Template Cleaning (lines 391-395)
- Added video element cleanup to drawGroupTemplate initialization
- Ensures fresh draw-groups don't have leftover video elements

## API Reference

### Sora 2 Models
- **sora-2**: Fast generation, good for iteration and social media content
- **sora-2-pro**: High quality, slower, best for production content

### Video Generation Endpoint
```
POST https://api.openai.com/v1/videos
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Fields:
- prompt: string (description of video to generate)
- model: "sora-2" | "sora-2-pro"
- size: "720x720" | "720x1280" | "1280x720"
- seconds: string (duration, e.g. "5")
```

### Status Check Endpoint
```
GET https://api.openai.com/v1/videos/{video_id}

Response:
{
  "id": "video_...",
  "status": "queued" | "in_progress" | "completed" | "failed",
  "progress": 0-100,
  "model": "sora-2",
  ...
}
```

### Download Endpoint
```
GET https://api.openai.com/v1/videos/{video_id}/content

Returns: video/mp4 blob
```

## User Experience

### Video Generation Flow
1. User selects "sora-2" from model dropdown
2. Aspect ratio automatically adjusts to video resolutions
3. Quality selector switches to sora-2/sora-2-pro options
4. User enters prompt and clicks "Draw"
5. Button shows "Creating video..." with progress percentage
6. Video appears in canvas with native controls (play/pause/scrub)
7. Copy/download buttons work with video format

### Video Display
- Videos play inline in the canvas area
- Native HTML5 video controls provided
- Videos autoplay and loop
- No lightbox for videos (they play in place)

## Testing

A test script is provided at `test-sora-api.js`:

```bash
# Set your API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run the test
node test-sora-api.js
```

This script:
- Verifies the Sora 2 API endpoint is accessible
- Creates a test video generation job
- Checks the job status
- Logs the response format for verification

## Known Limitations

1. **Video generation time**: Can take several minutes (up to 10 min max)
2. **No lightbox**: Videos play inline only (no fullscreen lightbox)
3. **Reference images**: Not yet supported for video generation (image-only feature)
4. **PDF export**: Videos not included in PDF generation (images only)
5. **Progress updates**: Updates every 5 seconds during generation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add video duration selector (currently fixed at 5 seconds)
- Support reference images for video generation (if API adds support)
- Implement video lightbox with larger player
- Add video thumbnails to gallery view
- Include videos in PDF export (as QR codes or links)
- Add video remix functionality
- Support audio track download separately

## Compatibility

- Works with all modern browsers that support:
  - HTML5 video element
  - Blob URLs
  - Clipboard API (for copy function)
  - FormData (for multipart uploads)

## Notes

- The duplicate `id="model"` issue (image model vs text model) was not fixed per user request
- Videos use the same preset prompts as images (Coloring Book, Photo, Sketches, None)
- Quality selector values are interpreted differently for video models
- Video generation respects OpenAI's content restrictions (no faces, copyrighted content, etc.)
