# Credits to Dollars Migration - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Changes

### 1. Database Schema
- **Updated**: `netlify/schema.sql`
  - Added documentation that `tokens` column now stores balance in cents (INTEGER)
  - No schema changes needed - column name stays the same for backwards compatibility

### 2. Backend Functions

#### ‚úÖ Created: `netlify/functions/migrate-tokens-to-dollars.js`
- Queries all users with tokens > 0
- Converts using Tinker rate: `cents = Math.round(tokens * 1000 / 150000)`
- Updates database and returns summary

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `netlify/functions/purchase-tokens.js`
- Changed token amounts to credit amounts (in cents):
  - Micro: 1000 cents ($10.00)
  - Tinker: 2500 cents ($25.00)
  - Pro: 10000 cents ($100.00)
- Updated email templates to show dollar amounts
- Updated all logging to display dollars

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `netlify/functions/create-checkout-session.js`
- Updated PRICING object:
  - Micro: $10 charge ‚Üí $10 credit
  - Tinker: $25 charge ‚Üí $25 credit
  - Pro: $75 charge ‚Üí $100 credit (33% bonus!)
- Updated Stripe metadata to include `cents` instead of `tokens`
- Updated product descriptions to show dollar amounts

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `netlify/functions/stripe-webhook.js`
- Changed to process cents instead of tokens
- Updated email confirmation messages to show dollar amounts
- Updated all logging to display dollars

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `netlify/functions/deduct-tokens.js`
- Now works with cents (kept function name for backwards compatibility)
- Updated error messages and logging

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `netlify/functions/get-user-tokens.js`
- Returns balance in cents (column still named `tokens`)

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `app.js`

**New Functions Added:**
```javascript
// Format cents as dollar amount (e.g., 1234 cents -> "$12.34")
function formatDollarAmount(cents)

// Calculate video generation cost in cents based on model, duration, and resolution
function calculateVideoCost(model, duration, size)
```

**Pricing Logic:**
- Sora 2: $0.11/sec = 11 cents/sec (10% overhead included)
- Sora 2 Pro (720p): $0.33/sec = 33 cents/sec
- Sora 2 Pro (1024p): $0.55/sec = 55 cents/sec

**Updated:**
- `updateAuthUI()` - Now displays dollar amounts instead of token counts
- `refreshTokensFromDB()` - Updated logging to show dollars
- `deductTokens()` - Now deducts cents with proper cost calculation
- `checkTokensBeforeDraw()` - Updated modal references
- Video generation - Now calculates actual cost based on parameters

#### ‚úÖ Updated: `index.html`

**Pricing Modal Updated:**
- Micro: Pay $10, get $10 credit
- Tinker: Pay $25, get $25 credit (marked as "Popular")
- Pro: Pay $75, get $100 credit (marked as "Best value!" with "33% bonus!")
- Button text changed from "BUY TOKENS" to "ADD CREDITS"

## üìä Pricing Summary

### New Pricing Plans
| Plan | You Pay | You Get | Bonus |
|------|---------|---------|-------|
| Micro | $10 | $10 credit | 0% |
| Tinker | $25 | $25 credit | 0% |
| Pro | $75 | $100 credit | 33% |

### Video Generation Costs (with 10% overhead)
| Model | Resolution | Cost per Second |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Sora 2 | 720x1280 or 1280x720 | $0.11 |
| Sora 2 Pro | 720x1280 or 1280x720 | $0.33 |
| Sora 2 Pro | 1024x1792 or 1792x1024 | $0.55 |

**Example:**
- 8 second Sora 2 video = 8 √ó $0.11 = $0.88
- 8 second Sora 2 Pro (720p) video = 8 √ó $0.33 = $2.64
- 8 second Sora 2 Pro (1024p) video = 8 √ó $0.55 = $4.40

## üöÄ Running the Migration

### Option 1: Using the migration script (Local/Dev)

1. Start Netlify Dev:
```bash
netlify dev
```

2. In another terminal, run the migration:
```bash
node run-migration.js
```

### Option 2: Using the migration script (Production)

```bash
node run-migration.js --prod
```

### Option 3: Direct API call

**Local/Dev:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/migrate-tokens-to-dollars \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Production:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://app.draw.superfun.games/.netlify/functions/migrate-tokens-to-dollars \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## üìù Migration Details

### Conversion Formula
```
cents = Math.round(tokens * 1000 / 150000)
```

**Based on Tinker rate:**
- 150,000 tokens = $10.00 = 1000 cents
- 1 token ‚âà 0.00667 cents

### Migration Output
The migration function returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "usersConverted": 5,
  "totalTokensConverted": 750000,
  "totalCentsAfterConversion": 5000,
  "totalDollarsAfterConversion": "50.00",
  "conversions": [
    {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "oldTokens": 150000,
      "newCents": 1000,
      "newDollars": "10.00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Database Column Name**: The database column is still named `tokens` but now stores cents (INTEGER). This maintains backwards compatibility.

2. **One-Way Migration**: This migration converts all existing balances. It should only be run once after deployment.

3. **User Experience**: 
   - Users will see their balance displayed as dollars (e.g., "$10.23")
   - Video generation costs are automatically calculated and deducted
   - Clear pricing in the purchase modal

4. **Testing Recommended**: Test the migration on a dev/staging environment before running in production.
